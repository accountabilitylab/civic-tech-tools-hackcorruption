# Civic-tech tools to curb corruption

This repository was initiated by Development Gateway: An IREX Venture and Accountabiliy Lab as part of the HackCorruption project. It's purpose is to identify and classify open source code and tools that may be useful to anti-corruption activists. The repository contains all open source code used in the development of the tools created through the HackCorruption project. Details about tools produced through HackCorruption can be found [here](https://hackcorruption.org). 

Moving forward, our hope is that the repository will become an open-source community asset and be of benefit and use to digital anti-corruption activists around the world.

Currently, the repository is structured around several themes, including:

1. [Foundational anti-corruption data and metadata management tools and code](Foundational),
2. [Beneficial ownership](BeneficialOwnership),
3. [Open contracting](OpenContracting),
4. [Budget transparency and participatory budgeting](BudgetTransparency), 
5. [Climate finance transparency](ClimateFinanceTransparency); and
6. [Illicit financial flows](IllicitFinancialFlows).
