# Civic-tech tools to curb corruption

This repository was initiated by Development Gateway: An IREX Venture and Accountabiliy Lab as part of the HackCorruption project. It's purpose is to identify and classify open source code and tools that may be useful to anti-corruption activists. The repository contains all open source code used in the development of the tools created through the HackCorruption project. Details about tools produced through HackCorruption can be found here. 

Moving forward, our hope is that the repository will become an open-source community asset and be of benefit and use to digital anti-corruption activists around the world.

Currently, the repository is structured around five themes, including:

1. Foundational anti-corruption data and metadata management tools and code,
2. Beneficial ownership,
3. Open contracting,
4. Budget transparency and participatory budgeting, and
5. Climate finance transparency.
