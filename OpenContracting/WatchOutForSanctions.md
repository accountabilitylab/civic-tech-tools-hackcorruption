# Name

Watch Out For Sanctions

# Purpose

An open data mechanism that allows you to search whether a company is disqualified, has been identified as a company with irregular activities by the SAT (Companies that Invoice Simulated Operations or “EFOS”), or if it is on the OFAC list of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The intention of this tool is to unify information from various public sources, mainly from the Mexican government, in a single site, in a free and accessible format to facilitate the search on whether a company is eligible or trustworthy to participate in a public procurement process, and thus prevent possible dishonest contracts that may lead to acts of corruption.
