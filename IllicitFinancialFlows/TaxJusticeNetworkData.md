# Name

Tax Justice Network Data

# Purpose

The Tax Justice Network uses data from the World Bank and the IMF to create a Financial Vulnerability Index based on 8 different categories of trade and financial flows: trade (exports and imports), banking positions (claims and liabilities), foreign direct investment (outward and inward) and portfolio investment (outward and inward). These different categories and the laws surrounding them make up the indicators the Tax Justice Network uses to build Tax Haven Score Index and the Financial Secrecy Index. Both indexes are released every two years, with new additions to rankings. All scores are weighted against a "Global Scale" figure that factors in a country's economy size with larger countries having higher scores because of the portion of the economy they account for. Includes Tax Haven and Financial Secrecy Score Analysis by Country
