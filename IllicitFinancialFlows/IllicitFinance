# Name

Illicit Finance

# Purpose

The author, Albin Touma has an extensive background in research and data analysis. What motivated him to start Illicit Finance was the challenge of collecting data and exposing networks. Mr. Touma first experienced the complexity of illicit finance when building a global database of sanctioned entites and politically exposed persons, Know Your Sanctions. This side project quickly grew into different research projects on how illicit funds are used, but Mr. Touma withheld from publishing. In light of Russia's resource grab in Ukraine, Mr. Touma joined OSINT for Ukraine as an investigator documenting war crimes with a focus on illicit funds. After working on tools to support investigations in Ukraine, Mr. Touma decided it was time to publish findings in "Illicit Finance" as a way to collate investigations and share them with a broad audience of readers.
