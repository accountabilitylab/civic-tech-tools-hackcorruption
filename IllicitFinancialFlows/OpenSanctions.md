# Name

Open Sanctions

# Purpose

An open database of international sanctions data, persons of interest and politically exposed persons. OpenSanctions aggregates and provides a comprehensive open-source database of sanctions data, politically exposed persons, and related entities. Key functionalities in this codebase include: Parsing of raw source data, cleaning and standardization of data structures, deduplication to maintain data integrity, and exporting the data into various output formats. Open Sanctions builds on the Follow the Money framework, a JSON-focused anti-corruption data model, as the schema for all our crawlers. FtM data is then optionally exposed to simplified formats like CSV.
