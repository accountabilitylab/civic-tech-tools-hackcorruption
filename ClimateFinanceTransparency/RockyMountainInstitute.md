Rocky Mountain Institute

# Purpose

These tools help you to assess if a financial portfolio aligns with climate goals. They summarize key metrics attributed to the portfolio (e.g. production, emission factors), and calculate targets based on climate scenarios. They implement in R the last step of the free software ‘PACTA’ (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment; https://www.transitionmonitor.com/). Financial institutions use ‘PACTA’ to study how their capital allocation impacts the climate. This project has received funding from the European Union LIFE program and the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) supports this initiative on the basis of a decision adopted by the German Bundestag.
