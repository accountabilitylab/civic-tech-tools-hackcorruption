# Name

Climate Finance Package

# Purpose

Climate-finance is the python package to get, clean, and work with international public climate finance. You can use this package to get, rebuild, remix, and create using our tools and methodologies â€” all with only a few lines of code. Climate finance data is notoriously difficult to work with. It's messy - really messy - and comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes, scattered across multiple websites. The authors have built climate finance to lower the barriers to access many organizations face when seeking to conduct research or advocacy on these topics. For too long, bad data has restricted climate accountability. And for too long, global leaders have capitalized on bad data to dictate the narrative on climate finance.
